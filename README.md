# About

The script makes some graphs on covid19 cases using data from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)

## How to run the scripts

Each script creates a graphic:

Growth rate of cases:
``python -m covid19.growth_rate``

![plot 02](plot_02.png "Growth rate")

Confirmed cases:
``python -m covid19.confirmed_cases``

![plot 01](plot_01.png "Latam confirmed cases")


**DISCLAIMER**: I'm no statistician, data scientist, epidemiologist, nor I have any knowledge on viruses. I just have some free time and I'm playing around with the dataset and matplotlib, the graphs might not be accurate and/or have errors.
